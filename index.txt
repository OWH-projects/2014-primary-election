Authorities say clamp snapped during circus act
http://www.omaha.com/article/20140505/AP09/140509226/
Investigators are looking at a snapped clamp today after eight circus acrobats plummeted to the ground during an aerial stunt at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey circus. The company cautioned it's too early in the investigation to blame the accident on the clamp. None of the injuring in the Sunday accident were considered to be life-threatening, but two of the acrobats are still in critical condition today.
